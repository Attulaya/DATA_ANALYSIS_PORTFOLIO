## 4.IMDB Movies Analysis

### Description
The IMDB Movies Analysis project involves working with a dataset containing various columns related to different IMDB movies. The primary objective is to frame the problem and define a specific question that requires illumination.

To frame the problem, we begin by asking questions such as: "What do we see happening?" and "What is our hypothesis for the cause of the problem?" Through this process, we gain a deeper understanding of the problem's impact on stakeholders and the consequences of not solving it. By answering these questions, we define a problem to solve and identify the appropriate data to address it.

After defining the problem, we clean the data as necessary and employ data analysis techniques to explore the dataset and derive insights. The analysis involves utilizing the 5 Whys technique, which allows us to determine the root cause of the problem by repeatedly asking "Why".

### Method
Once the problem is better defined, the 5 Whys technique is employed to identify its root cause. This technique, also known as Root Cause Analysis, involves repeatedly asking "Why" to delve deeper into the underlying causes. It helps uncover the fundamental reasons behind the problem and provides a structured approach to analysis.

### Results
The project successfully addressed various questions regarding the dataset, leading to insightful answers and analysis. By employing the 5 Whys technique and thoroughly exploring the data, meaningful insights were derived. The results obtained shed light on the defined problem and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the IMDB movies dataset.




## 5.Bank Loan Case Study

### Description
